# FlameDetectionAPP For Fire Protection Department in WPI


This repo includes all my thesis project files, and the final product will be used by researchers from Fire Protection Department in WPI.

It will include both web Application and mobile Application.

The web Application is developed with flask framework and the mobile application is developed with ionic framework.
